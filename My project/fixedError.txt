How to fix fatal:the current branch master has no upstream branch


The fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch error occurs when you have not configured git in such a way that it creates a new branch on the remote. Therefore, you are only creating a new branch on the local computer.

Solution
You can fix the issue by typing:

""git push -u origin master""
This will fix the error, but only for the current issue. The following is a permanent fix that will automatically create a remote branch:

""git config --global push.default current""
The command above will fix the error and will always create a remote branch that tracks the local branch.
